    <p><center><h3>A Brief History Of Robots</h3></center></p>
    <div class="brd">
   <p> By definition, a robot is a programmable machine that can automatically perform a complex series of actions. Citizens cannot match the given flexibility and tireless dedication to the task at hand, and it’s not hard to see why these machines make certain people fear for their jobs.</p>
    <p> <mark>A robot is an automatic device designed to carry out various types of mechanical operations, which operates according to a predetermined program.</mark></p>
  <p>The robot can independently carry out production and other operations, partially or completely replacing human labor. In this case, the robot can both have communication with the operator, receiving commands from him (manual control), and act autonomously, in accordance with the laid down program.</p>
  <p>The word "robotics" was also coined by a writer.  Russian-born American science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov first used the word in 1942 in his short story "Runabout."  Asimov had a much brighter and more optimistic opinion of the robot's role in human society than did Capek.  He generally characterized the robots in his short stories as helpful servants of man and viewed robots as "a better, cleaner race."  Asimov also proposed three "Laws of Robotics" that his robots, as well as sci-fi robotic characters of many other stories, followed:</p>

<p><h4>Law One:</h4></p>
       <p> A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p>
<p><h4>Law Two:</h4></p>
       <p> A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p>
<p><h4>Law Three:</h4></p>
        <p>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</p>
  <p> The term robot comes from the Czech word "Robota" meaning "forced labour" which was coined by Karel Capek in 1921. The world's first robot was created in - Ancient Greece. It was a wood pigeon. But the first modern robots as we know them were created in the early 1950s by an inventor from Louisville, Kentucky George Charles Devol.  The first commercial, digital, and programmable Robot was created by George in the 1950s and was named "unimate". It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from machines. </p>
  <p>The first <b>modern</b> digital and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and spawned his seminal robotics company, Unimation. The first Unimate was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it lifted pieces of hot metal. </p>

  <p><center><h3>Types:</h3></center></p> 
<p>There are 5 types of robots. Robots is an autpmatic devices which uses as an automathic device whin include:</p> 

<p>1)Pre-programmed robots perform only easy and monotonous tasks, but faster and better than a human. They can only do the function which was programmed previously. For example, robots have mechanical arms which helps n the development of the car.</p>

<p>2) Humanoids are robots that look like a human and have mimics of human. There are usually perform human activities like jumping, running, carrying objects. For example, Sofia.</p>

<p>3) Autunomous robots- these are robots that doing tasks with a high degree of autonomy their function is cleaning housekeeping and delivery of Good. Nowadays we have felt enormous robots in hotels and restaurants, for example of a Japanese restaurant with robots.</p> 

<p>4) Teleoperated robots usually work in extreme geographic conditions weather and etcetera. for example, drones and submarines, satellites Robots, for researching underwater exploration and the space.</p>

<p>5) Augmenting robots give opportunities to people who have complications and have lost part of their bodies for instance robotic prosthesis and exoskeleton.....</p>
